## Installation

  $ chmod +x Run
  $ ./Run
  ```

- **Running on Termux**

## Error Handling
- If you encounter issues with dumping IDs, you can make sure the target has a lot of followers/following and make sure the username is correct!
- If you experience issues with login or token validation, you can try to change the BlueSky token and make sure the token is correct!
- If you don't get results, this is because the target is not good enough or has a password that is difficult to guess. Maybe you chose the wrong password list!
- If you encounter any errors while hacking, you can just ignore them, we found that if you still need airplane mode then the hack runs smoothly!
